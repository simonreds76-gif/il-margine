## SECTION 11: KEY METRICS GLOSSARY

### Heading
**Understanding The Numbers**

### Definitions

**ROI (Return on Investment)**
```
Formula: (Total Profit / Total Staked) × 100
Example: +25% ROI means for every £100 staked, you profit £25
```

**Units**
```
A unit is your standard bet size.
If 1u = £10, then +195u profit = £1,950
If 1u = £100, then +195u profit = £19,500
```

**Win Rate**
```
Percentage of bets that won.
Important: Win rate alone is meaningless without knowing average odds.
58% win rate at 1.50 odds = long-term loss
58% win rate at 2.00 odds = long-term profit
```

**Average Odds**
```
Mean decimal odds across all bets.
Higher average odds = lower required win rate for profitability
```

**Stake Distribution**
```
How we vary bet sizing based on edge confidence.
0.05u = minimal edge, exploratory bet
5.0u = maximum edge, highest confidence
```
