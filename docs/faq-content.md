## SECTION 1: GETTING STARTED

### Q: What is Il Margine?

**A:** Il Margine is a professional sports betting analysis service founded by a former UK odds compiler with 25+ years in the betting industry. We identify mathematical edges in markets where bookmakers systematically misprice selections - specifically football player props and ATP tennis.

Unlike traditional tipsters who focus on match outcomes, we target inefficient markets where bookmaker pricing models are less sophisticated. Our name, Italian for "the margin" or "the edge," reflects our core philosophy: exploit the margin between true probability and bookmaker odds.

---

### Q: How do I start following Il Margine's betting tips?

**A:** Getting started is simple:

1. **Join our free Telegram channel:** [@IlMargineProps](https://t.me/IlMargineProps). **Football player props** are posted there so everyone has a chance to get on before odds move.
2. **Tennis tips** are published on the website only initially; you do not need Telegram for those.
3. **Anytime goalscorer** markets and **bet builders** are coming very soon.
4. **Review the tip:** Each includes match details, market, selection, bookmaker, odds, and stake recommendation.
5. **Place your bet:** Use your own bankroll and stake sizing.
6. **Track results:** Every bet is verified on our website with immutable records.

No payment required. No trial period. No credit card.

---

### Q: Do I need a Telegram account to follow your tips?

**A:** Only for **football player props**. Those are published on Telegram so that everyone can get on the bet before odds change or move; the website is updated afterwards. For **ATP tennis** you do not need Telegram. Tennis tips are published on the website. Anytime goalscorer and bet builder selections are coming very soon.

---

### Q: How often do you post betting tips?

**A:** We post when our analysis identifies genuine value. We do not force selections to meet a schedule. **Quality over quantity.**

**Typical volume:**
- **Player props:** broadly 60 to 80+ selections per month when fixtures allow.
- **ATP tennis:** broadly 35 to 50+ selections per month across the calendar.

These figures vary with the fixture list and where we find edge.

---

### Q: What time of day do you post tips?

**A:** Tips are posted at any time during the day. For **player props**, expect selections up to around an hour before kick-off when we are waiting for official team news. For **ATP tennis**, bets are usually posted as soon as odds are available; often the day before the match, or on the day if relevant information becomes available.

---

## SECTION 2: BETTING PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH

### Q: What does "betting with mathematical edge" mean?

**A:** Edge is the difference between true probability and implied probability from bookmaker odds.

**Example:**
- True probability of Saka getting 2+ shots on target: 55%
- Bookmaker odds: 2.10 (implies 47.6% probability)
- Edge: 55% - 47.6% = 7.4%

When you consistently bet with positive edge, you profit long-term despite short-term variance.

**Our edge sources:**
1. Former compiler experience identifying mispriced markets
2. Focus on markets with less sophisticated pricing models
3. Systematic analysis bookmakers don't prioritize
4. Bookmaker-to-bookmaker price discrepancies

Edge isn't about "feeling" or "expert opinion." It's mathematical probability assessment.

---

### Q: Why don't you post tips on mainstream markets like match odds?

**A:** **Match odds are too efficient.**

Bookmakers employ teams of traders, sophisticated algorithms, and real-time monitoring for 1X2 markets. Margins are 3-5% and pricing is razor-sharp.

**Player props are inefficient.**

The same bookmakers apply 10-15% margins to player props and use template pricing with minimal manual oversight. These markets receive a fraction of the analytical resources.

**ATP tennis game handicaps and totals:** We have had strong results with our model in these markets (ATP 250/500 and Challenger level). We focus where our analysis adds value rather than on the most liquid match-odds markets.

---

### Q: What is ROI and why does it matter more than win rate?

**A:** **ROI (Return on Investment)** measures profitability as a percentage of total stakes.

**Formula:** (Total Profit ÷ Total Staked) × 100

**Example:**
- 100 bets at 1.0 unit stakes = 100 units staked
- Win 60 bets at average odds of 2.00 = 120 units returned
- Profit: 20 units
- **ROI: +20%**

**Why ROI matters more than win rate:**

| Scenario   | Win rate | Avg odds | ROI    | Verdict   |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Bettor A  | 65%      | 1.50     | -2.5%  | Losing    |
| Bettor B  | 52%      | 2.20     | +14.4% | Winning   |

Bettor A wins more often but loses money. Bettor B wins less often but is profitable over time.

**Betting isn't about being right. It's about being right when the odds compensate for risk.**

---

### Q: Why do you use unit-based staking instead of currency amounts?

**A:** **Units are bankroll-agnostic.**

One person's 1 unit might be £10.  
Another person's 1 unit might be £100.

By recommending stakes in units (e.g., "2.5u" or "1.0u"), followers can scale to their bankroll size while maintaining proper risk management.

**Standard recommendation:**
- 1 unit = 1-2% of total bankroll
- Never exceed 5 units on a single selection

**Example:**
- £1,000 bankroll → 1u = £10-20
- £10,000 bankroll → 1u = £100-200

This approach ensures sustainable betting regardless of bankroll size.

---

### Q: What is your staking plan?

**A:** We use **variable unit staking** based on edge confidence:

| Edge confidence | Stake size   | Frequency   |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Exploratory     | 0.05u to 0.5u  | ~5% of bets |
| Standard        | 1.0u        | ~50% of bets|
| Strong          | 2.0u to 3.0u   | ~40% of bets|
| Maximum         | 5.0u        | ~5% of bets |

Not all edges are equal: when our analysis points to stronger value we stake more; when edge is marginal or we are testing an angle we stake less.

---

### Q: Do you recommend betting singles or accumulators?

**A:** **Singles only. Always.**

Accumulators (parlays) are mathematically inferior because:

1. **Bookmaker margins compound**
   - 3 selections at 5% margin each = 14.3% combined margin
   - Your edge evaporates

2. **Variance amplifies**
   - One wrong selection loses the entire bet
   - Reduces long-term profitability

3. **Edge dilution**
   - If you have 3 bets with 7% edge each, combining them doesn't give you 21% edge
   - Statistical independence means edge compounds poorly

**Example:**
- 5 singles at 2.00 odds with 55% true win probability: expected profit +£27.50 per £100 staked.
- Same five legs as a 5-fold accumulator: expected loss -£14.80.

Bookmakers love accumulators. Professional bettors avoid them.

---

### Q: What does "variance" mean in betting?

**A:** **Variance** is short-term deviation from expected results.

You can have +25% ROI long-term but still experience:
- 12-bet losing streaks
- Losing months
- Unexpected drawdowns

**Example from our record:**
- February 2025: 12 consecutive losing bets
- Yet annual ROI: +19%

**Why variance matters:**
- Tests emotional discipline
- Requires proper bankroll management
- Separates professionals from recreational bettors

**Managing variance:**
- Never risk more than 2% of bankroll on a single bet (max 5u)
- Maintain a bankroll of 100+ units where possible
- Accept that losing streaks are inevitable
- Trust the process over 100+ bets

Variance is why we track performance over 1,000+ bets, not 10 or 50.

---

## SECTION 3: MARKETS & BETTING TYPES

### Q: What are player props in football betting?

**A:** **Player props** (short for propositions) are bets on individual player statistics within a match, rather than the match outcome.

**Common player prop markets:**

**Shooting metrics:**
- Shots taken (Over/Under)
- Shots on target (Over/Under)

**Foul metrics:**
- Fouls committed
- Fouls won/drawn

**Defensive metrics:**
- Tackles made

**Disciplinary:**
- Player to be booked (yellow/red card)
- Total cards for player

**Creative:**
- Assists

**Why we focus here:** Bookmakers price these markets less efficiently than match odds, creating exploitable value.

---

### Q: What is the difference between "Over 1.5 shots" and "2+ shots"?

**A:** They're **functionally identical** but presented differently:

- **Over 1.5 shots** = Player needs 2 or more
- **2+ shots** = Player needs 2 or more
- **Under 1.5 shots** = Player needs 0 or 1

Some bookmakers use "Over/Under" terminology, others use "2+ / 1 or fewer."

**Key point:** "1.5" is the line. You can't score 1.5 shots, so it's binary:
- 2+ shots = Over wins
- 0-1 shots = Under wins

This applies to all fractional lines: Over 2.5 fouls = 3+ fouls needed.

---

### Q: What does "anytime goalscorer" (ATG) mean?

**A:** **Anytime Goalscorer** is a bet that a specific player will score at least one goal during the match, regardless of:
- When they score (1st minute or 90th minute)
- How many they score (1 goal or hat-trick both win)
- Match result (player can score in a losing team)

**Example:**
- Bet: Erling Haaland Anytime Goalscorer @ 1.80
- Result: Man City wins 3-1, Haaland scores 2 goals
- Outcome: Bet wins (only needed 1 goal)

**ATG vs First Goalscorer:**
- ATG: Player scores anytime in match
- First Goalscorer: Player scores the first goal of the match (higher odds)

We'll be launching ATG selections soon, focusing on opposition-specific scoring patterns and tactical matchups.

---

### Q: What are game handicaps in tennis?

**A:** **Game handicaps** are spread bets on the total games won by each player.

**Example:**
- Match: Alcaraz vs Tiafoe
- Handicap: Alcaraz -3.5 games @ 1.95

**How it settles:**
- Alcaraz wins 6-3, 6-4 (10 games vs 7 games)
- Game differential: 10 - 7 = 3 games
- Handicap was -3.5, so Alcaraz needed to win by 4+ games
- **Result: Bet loses** (won by 3, needed 4)

**Alternative outcome:**
- Alcaraz wins 6-2, 6-3 (12 games vs 5 games)
- Differential: 7 games
- **Result: Bet wins** (won by 7, needed 4)

---

### Q: What does "total games Over/Under" mean in tennis?

**A:** **Total games** is the combined number of games played by both players.

**Example:**
- Match: Sinner vs Rublev
- Total: Over 21.5 games @ 1.90

**How it settles:**
- Result: Sinner wins 7-6, 6-4
- Games: 7+6+6+4 = 23 games total
- **Result: Bet wins** (23 > 21.5)

**Alternative outcome:**
- Result: Sinner wins 6-3, 6-2
- Games: 6+3+6+2 = 17 games
- **Result: Bet loses** (17 < 21.5)

**Factors affecting totals:**
- Serve dominance (big servers = fewer break points = fewer games)
- Surface speed (clay = longer rallies = more breaks = more games)
- Player styles (defensive baseline grinders = more games)

We focus on totals where our model identifies value.

---

### Q: What is a bet builder?

**A:** **Bet builders** (same-game parlays/multiples) let you combine multiple selections from a single match into one bet.

**Example:**
- Arsenal vs Wolves
- Selection 1: Arsenal to win
- Selection 2: Over 2.5 goals
- Selection 3: Saka 2+ shots on target
- **Combined odds:** 5.50

**All three must win** for the bet to pay out.

**Why bet builders create value:**
Bookmakers struggle to price **correlation** properly.

**Example of positive correlation:**
- "Arsenal to win" + "Over 2.5 goals" are positively correlated
- If Arsenal wins, more likely to be high-scoring
- But bookmakers often price these as independent events

**Coming soon:** We'll be launching bet builder selections that exploit correlation mispricing.

---

## SECTION 4: BOOKMAKERS & ACCOUNTS

### Q: Which bookmakers do you recommend?

**A:** See our [Bookmakers page](/bookmakers) for full reviews and recommendations.

---

### Q: What does "getting limited" mean?

**A:** **Limiting** (or restricting) is when bookmakers reduce your maximum stake.

**Example progression:**
- Week 1: £200 max stake
- Week 8: £100 max stake
- Week 12: £20 max stake
- Week 16: £5 max stake (effectively banned)

**Why bookmakers limit:** They may restrict accounts when they flag consistent profitability or sharp betting patterns.

**Who gets limited:** Value bettors who win long-term, arbitrage bettors, bonus abusers, and others who bet in a way that is profitable over time.

**How to extend account life:** See our [Bookmakers page](/bookmakers) for strategies.

---

### Q: Why don't you just use Pinnacle if they have the best odds?

**A:** Pinnacle is excellent but has limitations:

**Pinnacle Pros:**
- Best odds in the industry (lowest margins)
- Never limits winners
- High stake limits
- Respected by professionals

**Pinnacle cons:**
- Not licensed in the UK; access is via brokers only
- Doesn't offer player props (our primary market)
- Very limited prop markets generally
- Odds are very sharp, so edge is harder to find

**How we use Pinnacle:** As a benchmark when our selection is better priced than Pinnacle, it's likely +EV. We don't use it for player props (they don't offer them). In the UK you can only access Pinnacle through brokers.

---

### Q: Can I use betting bots or automation tools?

**A:** **We don't recommend automation for several reasons:**

**Why not:**
1. **Bookmakers detect bots** - Instant limiting
2. **Reduces account longevity** - Human-like behavior extends account life
3. **Misses context** - Automation can't adapt to team news changes
4. **Against terms of service** - Risk of account closure

**What we recommend instead:**
- Manual betting with price alerts
- Use odds comparison sites to get the best price
- Set up Telegram notifications for instant alerts

**Professional bettors bet manually.** Speed matters less than getting best price and maintaining account health.

---

## SECTION 6: COSTS & MONETIZATION

### Q: How much does Il Margine cost?

**A:** **Free.** We are growing our follower base and proving our approach; there is no charge to receive tips. What you get: all selections (player props on Telegram, tennis on the website), real-time alerts, and full verification. No trial period, no credit card. We may introduce paid tiers or other monetization later; for now the service is free.

---

### Q: Do you have affiliate relationships with bookmakers?

**A:** The bookmakers we recommend are those we are most comfortable with for odds, markets, and usability. We do not list Bet365 or others where a recommendation might look like an affiliate push; we prefer to keep our suggestions clearly independent.

---

## SECTION 7: BETTING STRATEGY & BANKROLL MANAGEMENT

### Q: What is bankroll management and why does it matter?

**A:** **Bankroll management** is the system for determining stake sizes to survive variance without going bust.

**Key principle:** Never risk too much on a single bet.

**Recommended bankroll structure:**

| Guideline | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Minimum bankroll | 100 units |
| Max per bet | 2% of bankroll (never more than 5u) |
| Standard 1u | 1 to 2% of bankroll |

- A 100-unit bankroll lets you survive extended losing streaks and keep 1u stakes.
- Never risk more than 2% of your bankroll on a single bet (capped at 5u).

**Example:** £5,000 bankroll → 1u = £50 to £100; max single bet 5u = £250.

---

### Q: Should I bet a percentage of my bankroll or fixed units?

**A:** We recommend **percentage-based sizing** so your stake moves with your bankroll.

**Method:**
- 1 unit = 1 to 2% of current bankroll
- Recalculate unit size monthly (or after ±20% bankroll change)

**Example:**

| Bankroll | 1u (at 1.5%) | 3u max |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| £1,000 | £15 | £45 |
| £1,500 (after growth) | £22.50 | £67.50 |
| £800 (after drawdown) | £12 | £36 |

**Why this works:** It compounds when you win and cuts exposure when you lose. Never risk more than 2% on a single bet (max 5u), chase losses, or shrink unit size when winning. Good bankroll management is what separates long-term survivors from those who blow up after a bad run.

---

### Q: What should I do during a losing streak?

**A:** **Continue following the strategy. Losing streaks are inevitable.**

**Mathematical reality:**
With 58% win rate, probability of losing streaks:
- 5 losses in a row: 12.8% chance (happens regularly)
- 8 losses in a row: 2.3% chance (happens occasionally)
- 12 losses in a row: 0.26% chance (happened to us in Feb 2025)

**What NOT to do:**
✗ Increase stakes to "chase losses"  
✗ Start betting randomly to "get back to even"  
✗ Abandon strategy after 10-bet losing streak  
✗ Emotional decisions based on short-term results  

**What TO do:**
✓ Review bankroll management (do you have 100+ units?)  
✓ Verify you're actually following the selections correctly  
✓ Remember edge manifests over 100+ bets, not 10  
✓ Continue disciplined staking  
✓ Take a break if emotionally affected  

**Historical perspective:**
We experienced 12-bet losing streak in February 2025. Over next 6 weeks, recovered entirely and reached new profit highs.

**Variance tests discipline.** Those who abandon strategy during drawdowns never experience long-term profitability.

---

### Q: Can I increase stakes when I'm winning?

**A:** **Yes, but systematically, not emotionally.**

**Good approach (percentage-based):**
- Start: £1,000 bankroll, 1u = £15 (1.5%)
- After growth: £1,500 bankroll, 1u = £22.50
- Natural compounding from bankroll growth

**Bad approach (emotional):**
- Win 5 bets → "I'm hot, let's bet £100 instead of £20!"
- Lose next 3 bets → Wipe out previous gains + more
- Emotional rollercoaster destroys bankroll

**Kelly Criterion (advanced):** Stake % = (Edge × Odds − 1) ÷ (Odds − 1). Most professionals use fractional Kelly (e.g. ¼ or ½) to reduce variance.

**Our recommendation:** Keep 1 to 2% of bankroll per unit. Recalculate monthly or after ±20% bankroll swings. Let compounding come from bankroll growth, not from raising stakes because you feel "on a roll".

---

## SECTION 9: TECHNICAL BETTING QUESTIONS

### Q: What is closing line value (CLV)?

**A:** **Closing line value** measures whether you beat the final odds before the match starts.

**Example:**
- You bet: Arsenal -1.5 @ 2.10 (12 hours before match)
- Closing line (1 minute before kickoff): Arsenal -1.5 @ 1.85
- **CLV: +0.25 odds** (you got better price)

**Why CLV matters:**
- Strong predictor of long-term profitability
- Sharp money moves markets
- If you consistently beat closing line, you're selecting +EV bets

**Il Margine approach:**
We post selections early enough for followers to get good odds, but late enough to have team news.

**Goal:** Followers should consistently achieve close to our posted odds. If market moves heavily after we post, we beat closing line.

---

### Q: What does "value" mean in betting?

**A:** **Value** exists when your probability assessment exceeds the bookmaker's implied probability.

**Formula:**
Expected Value (EV) = (Win Probability × Decimal Odds) - 1

**Example:**
- True probability of Saka 2+ SOT: 55%
- Bet365 odds: 2.10 (implies 47.6%)
- EV = (0.55 × 2.10) - 1 = 0.155 or **+15.5% edge**

**Positive EV (+EV) = Value bet**  
**Negative EV (-EV) = Bad bet**

**Important:**
- Value ≠ guaranteed win
- Value = mathematically profitable long-term
- You'll lose many value bets (variance)
- Consistent value betting = long-term profit

**Our job:** Identify when our assessment of probability exceeds the odds on offer, creating value opportunities.

---

### Q: What does "soft market" vs "sharp market" mean?

**A:** Refers to market efficiency and pricing sophistication.

**Sharp Markets (Efficient):**
- Match odds (1X2) in major leagues
- Liquid markets with high betting volume
- Multiple sharp bettors competing
- Bookmaker dedicates resources
- Tight margins (3-5%)
- Hard to find edge

**Soft Markets (Inefficient):**
- Player props
- Lower league match odds
- ATP 250/Challenger tennis
- Niche markets
- Less betting volume
- Wider margins (10-15%)
- Easier to find edge

**Why this matters:**
We target soft markets because that's where bookmakers are beatable.

**Analogy:**
- Sharp market = playing poker against pros
- Soft market = playing poker against recreational players

We're not trying to outsmart the best bookmaker traders. We're exploiting markets they don't prioritize.

---

### Q: What is arbitrage betting and do you do it?

**A:** **Arbitrage** (arbing) is betting all outcomes at different bookmakers to guarantee profit.

**Example:**
- Bet365: Team A to win @ 2.10
- William Hill: Team B to win @ 2.05
- If balanced correctly: guaranteed 2-3% profit

**Why we don't do arbitrage:**

1. **Not sustainable**
   - Bookmakers instantly limit arbers
   - Requires dozens of accounts
   - Profit margins tiny (1-3%)

2. **Different philosophy**
   - Arbing is risk-free but labor-intensive
   - Value betting is higher edge but variance

3. **Account preservation**
   - We want followers to maintain bookmaker access
   - Arbing = fastest way to get limited

**Our approach:** Positive expected value betting, accepting variance for higher long-term returns.

---

### Q: Should I hedge my bets?

**A:** **Generally no, unless specific scenarios.**

**Hedging** = betting the opposite outcome to guarantee profit/minimize loss.

**Example:**
- Bet: Arsenal to win @ 3.00 (£100 stake)
- Arsenal winning 1-0 at 80th minute
- Option: Bet draw/Wolves @ 1.50 to guarantee profit

**Why we don't recommend hedging:**

1. **Reduces EV**
   - You had +EV on original bet
   - Hedging is usually -EV
   - Lowers long-term profit

2. **Emotional decision**
   - Based on fear, not mathematics
   - Undermines disciplined approach

3. **Over time, losers compound**
   - If you hedge every "safe" win, you're leaving money on table

**When hedging makes sense:**
- Life-changing amount at stake
- Injury/red card changes match fundamentally
- Accumulator (not recommended anyway)

**Professional approach:** Make +EV bets and let them run. Accept variance.

---

## SECTION 10: ABOUT THE SERVICE

### Q: Who is behind Il Margine?

**A:** Il Margine was founded by a **former UK odds compiler** with 25+ years in the betting industry.

**Background:** Worked for major UK bookmakers compiling odds; limited by every major bookmaker. Deep understanding of how bookmakers price markets.

**Why this matters:**
Most tipsters are:
- Recreational bettors who got lucky short-term
- Marketing operations selling "guaranteed winners"
- Stat aggregators without betting background

**Former compilers:**
- Know how bookmakers construct prices
- Understand where pricing models are weak
- Can identify systematic mispricing
- Have been proven profitable (hence being limited)

**Credentials:**
Being limited by bookmakers is the ultimate credential. They only limit consistent winners.

---

### Q: Why is it called "Il Margine"?

**A:** **Il Margine** is Italian for "the margin" or "the edge."

**Dual meaning:**

1. **Bookmaker margin**
   - The built-in profit bookmakers charge
   - Our goal: exploit weak margins in inefficient markets

2. **Betting edge**
   - The probabilistic advantage we seek
   - Difference between true odds and bookmaker odds

**Philosophy:**
"Mind the margin" - be aware of:
- Where bookmakers are weakest (their margin)
- Where we're strongest (our edge)

**Why Italian?** We love Serie A for our prop bets; the name fits that focus and stands out from generic "Pro Tips" branding.

---

### Q: Should I use betting as a way to make money?

**A:** **No. Betting should be entertainment, not income.**

**Reality check:**
- **99% of bettors lose long-term**
- Even with our +19% ROI, variance is extreme
- Requires significant bankroll (£2,000+ minimum)
- You can still lose money following profitable strategies (variance)
- Psychological pressure of "needing" to win ruins decisions

**Professional bettors:**
- Operate with £50K+ bankrolls
- Accept years of variance
- Have other income sources
- Treat it as a business (tax, records, etc.)

**Our recommendation:**
- Only bet entertainment money
- Money you're comfortable losing entirely
- Never bet rent/bill money
- Have stable income elsewhere

**If you're betting to pay bills:** Stop immediately and seek financial advice.

---

### Q: What are responsible betting limits?

**A:** Set personal limits based on disposable income:

**Recommended limits:**

**Monthly betting budget:**
- 1-5% of monthly disposable income AFTER all bills/savings
- Example: £2,000 monthly income, £1,500 expenses/savings = £500 disposable
- Betting budget: £5-25/month

**Per-bet limits:**
- Never more than 2% of betting bankroll on a single bet (aligns with our 1u = 1 to 2% guidance)
- Example: £500 bankroll = 1u = £5 to £10, max single bet 5u = £25 to £50

**Time limits:**
- Set maximum hours per week analyzing bets
- Don't let betting consume work/family time

**Loss limits:**
- Set monthly loss limit
- If hit, stop betting for the month
- Never chase losses

**Win limits:**
- Consider cashing out after significant wins
- Don't reinvest all profits immediately

**Tools:**
- Most bookmakers offer deposit limits
- Set these BEFORE you start betting
- Can't be increased for 24-72 hours (cooling-off period)

## SECTION 12: ADVANCED CONCEPTS

### Q: What is expected value (EV) in betting?

**A:** **Expected value** is the average result if you could repeat a bet indefinitely.

**Formula:** EV = (Probability of win × Profit if win) − (Probability of loss × Loss if loss)

**Worked example:**

| Input | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Stake | £10 @ 2.10 |
| True probability of win | 55% |
| If win | Return £21, profit £11 |
| If lose | Lose £10 |

EV = (0.55 × £11) − (0.45 × £10) = £6.05 − £4.50 = **+£1.55 per bet**

Over 100 such bets you would expect about £155 profit. Individual results vary (variance); +EV bets can lose and −EV bets can win. Professional betting means consistently finding +EV opportunities.

### Q: What is implied probability and how do bookmaker margins work?

**A:** **Implied probability** is the probability implied by the odds.

**Calculation:** Implied probability = 1 ÷ decimal odds

**Example:** Odds 2.10 → 1 ÷ 2.10 = 47.6% implied probability.

**Bookmaker margin (overround):** In a binary market the two sides would sum to 100% if fair. Bookmakers add margin so the total exceeds 100%.

**Example:**

| Selection | Odds | Implied % |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Over 1.5 SOT | 2.10 | 47.6% |
| Under 1.5 SOT | 1.83 | 54.6% |
| **Total** | n/a | **102.2%** |

The extra 2.2% is the bookmaker margin.

**Typical margins by market:**

| Market type | Typical margin |
|-------------|----------------|
| Match odds (efficient) | 3 to 5% |
| Player props (softer) | 10 to 15% |

Larger margins mean more room for mispricing and value when our assessment differs from the book’s.

### Q: What is Elo rating and how do you use it?

**A:** **Elo** is a rating system that assigns numerical values to competitors' relative strength.

**Originally from chess, now used in sports.**

**Tennis Elo example:**
- Novak Djokovic: 2350 Elo
- Generic ATP 250 player: 1850 Elo
- Differential: 500 points = Djokovic massive favorite

**How we use it:**

**Surface-specific Elo (crucial for tennis):**
- Nadal clay Elo: 2400
- Nadal grass Elo: 2200
- Different surfaces = different ratings

**Why this matters:**
Bookmakers often use universal Elo. We use **surface-specific Elo**, creating edge when:
- Player is underrated on specific surface
- Opponent is overrated on specific surface

**Example:**
- Player A: Universal Elo 2000, but Clay Elo 2150
- Player B: Universal Elo 2050, but Clay Elo 1900
- Match on clay
- Bookmaker prices based on universal Elo (close match)
- Reality: Player A has 250-point advantage on clay
- **Value exists**

**Our models integrate:**
- Surface-specific Elo
- Recent form adjustments
- Head-to-head history
- Tournament tier context

---

### Q: What statistical models do you use?

**A:** Our models combine multiple approaches:

**For Player Props:**

1. **Player-specific baselines**
   - Rolling averages over 10, 20, 50 matches
   - Home vs away splits
   - Competition tier adjustments

2. **Opponent-specific factors**
   - Defensive metrics (shots allowed, fouls conceded)
   - Tactical style (high press vs low block)
   - Individual matchup history

3. **Situational modifiers**
   - Referee tendencies (strict vs lenient)
   - Weather conditions
   - Match importance
   - Lineup position

4. **Regression analysis**
   - Identify predictive variables
   - Weight factors by correlation to outcomes

**For Tennis:**

1. **Surface-specific Elo**
   - Hard court, clay, grass ratings separately
   - Indoor vs outdoor adjustments

2. **Serve/return dynamics**
   - First serve %, aces, double faults
   - Break point conversion
   - Service games won %

3. **Tournament tier effects**
   - Grand Slam vs ATP 250 motivation differences
   - Travel fatigue modeling

4. **Matchup-specific**
   - Head-to-head history
   - Playing style compatibility

**Proprietary elements:**
We don't disclose exact formulas (competitive advantage), but approach is systematic and data-driven, not gut-feel.

## SECTION 13: COMMON MISTAKES & MISCONCEPTIONS

### Q: Why shouldn't I bet on every match?

**A:** **Volume without value is guaranteed long-term loss.**

**Math is simple:**
- Bookmaker margin on match odds: 5%
- If you bet randomly without edge: -5% ROI long-term
- Over 100 bets: -5 units
- Over 1,000 bets: -50 units

**The trap:**
- Entertainment value of "having action"
- FOMO on matches you watch
- Feeling like you "should" have an opinion

**Professional approach:**
- Most matches have NO value
- Maybe 5-10% of matches offer exploitable value
- Patience is profitable
- Boredom is part of the process

**Quality over quantity:**
- 10 bets with +15% EV > 100 bets with +2% EV
- Fewer bets with higher edge = better ROI

**If you need action on every match:** You have entertainment motivation, not profit motivation. That's fine, but don't confuse it with professional betting.

### Q: Why don't "guaranteed sure bets" exist?

**A:** **Nothing in sports betting is guaranteed except variance.**

**Why tipsters claim "sure bets":**
1. Marketing (attracts desperate bettors)
2. Ignorance (don't understand probability)
3. Scam (knowingly lying)

**Reality check:**

**Even heavy favorites lose:**
- 1.10 odds = 90% implied probability
- Still loses 1 in 10 times
- That's a 10% failure rate

**Weather, injuries, refereeing:**
- Unpredictable factors affect every match
- Red cards change everything
- Variance is infinite in sports

**Mathematical impossibility:**
If sure bets existed:
- Professional bettors would bet millions
- Bookmakers would go bankrupt
- Market would instantly correct

**What we offer:**
- Positive expected value (+EV)
- Long-term mathematical edge
- Transparent variance
- **NOT guarantees**

Anyone promising guaranteed wins is either lying or delusional.

### Q: Can I trust tipsters who claim 80%+ win rates?

**A:** **Be extremely skeptical.**

**Red flags:**

1. **Cherry-picked timeframes**
   - "80% win rate this month!" (small sample)
   - Ignore longer-term losing periods

2. **Selective reporting**
   - Only publish winning bets
   - Delete losing bets
   - Edit historical record

3. **Low odds inflation**
   - Bet heavy favorites at 1.20 odds
   - 80% win rate but negative ROI

4. **Mathematical impossibility**
   - If someone genuinely had 80% win rate at 2.00+ odds
   - They'd be billionaires
   - Bookmakers would instantly limit them

**Reality check:**

**Professional win rates:**
- Match odds betting: 52-55%
- Player props: 55-60%
- Tennis: 52-56%

**With corresponding odds:**
- Higher win rates = lower average odds
- Lower win rates = higher average odds
- **ROI matters more than win rate**

**Our win rates (56.4% overall)** are realistic for the odds we target (2.06 average).

Anyone claiming 80%+ win rate at 2.00+ average odds is lying.
