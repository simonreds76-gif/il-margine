## Required Fields

- `current_model_would_have_priced` must be true while canonical-only evidence is blocked.
- `time_to_kickoff_hours` records publication timing so CLV can be interpreted by lead time.
- `published_to_close_clv` tracks the captured bookmaker price versus close.
- `close_lag_minutes` records how far the selected close snapshot was from kickoff; `true_close=true` requires <=120 minutes.
- `model_to_close_clv` tracks the model-implied probability versus close.
- `model_mean` preserves the frozen count expectation so weekly actual-minus-model bias is observable.
- Side mix is diagnostic: strong Over shading can make Under selections dominant by construction.
- `confidence_guard_applied=true` means the row must not be treated as a published pick.

## De-Promotion Rules

- Pause `team_shots_v4` if 30-day rolling CLV is below 0 with at least 50 settled picks.
- Pause `team_shots_v4` if rolling 90-day production Brier exceeds 1.05x the pre-promotion backtest Brier.
